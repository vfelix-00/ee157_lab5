# Lab 5: Working with Stepper Motors

## Overview

In this lab, the objectives were to measure the winding configuration of our stepper motor, measure the back-EMF of our stepper motor, generate a schematic that enables the Toshiba TB6674PG to drive the stepper motor, and to wire the circuit and generate the code that will drive our stepper motor in both clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions.
